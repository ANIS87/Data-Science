# Data-Science
The goal of this project  is to analyze the user's behavior on the web pages  using a hidden markov model. 



The final code  contains three folder:

*  Clustering_Users : an implementation of a k-means algorithm that should be used to classify a list of users by relying on their behaviours.
*  data : a csv file contains the data. 
*  Hidden_Markov_Model: an implementation of hidden markov model 
*  Markov_Matrix: extraction of markov matrix from the data. 
*  test: an example of test.
